# This file contains the laboratories, and associate them to the resources. In LDE, you can
# have multiple remote laboratories, and multiple copies of each of them. You might even have
# resources shared among two laboratories. For example, in LabsLand, the Arduino Robot is a remote
# laboratory and you can select any robot, or robots that have one type of path or another type
# of path. If we had 4 robots (2 with one path and 2 with the other), we can have 3 laboratories: one
# with two resources, the other one with the other 2 resources and a general one with all 4 resources
# 
# This file is focused on information that the user should be aware: name of the lab, category, image, etc.
