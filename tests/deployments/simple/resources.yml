# This file contains the laboratory resources. For example, you may have 3 copies of
# the same laboratory. In LDE, we call this 3 resources of one laboratory. Therefore,
# here you can specify and document the particular resources (the URL, login, password,
# healthchecks of the resource, etc). Later, in the laboratories.yml file you will be
# able to specify the name of the laboratory, which resources are assigned to what
# laboratory, and information that the user should see (e.g., the image, category, etc.)

dummy-1:
  # Include the URL and credentials of the remote laboratory
  url: http://localhost:5000
  login: lde # If always the same use DEFAULT_RESOURCE_LOGIN in credentials.yml
  password: password # If always the same use DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PASSWORD in credentials.yml

dummy-2:
  # Include the URL and credentials of the remote laboratory
